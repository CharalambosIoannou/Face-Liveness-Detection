# Face Liveness Detection

For my final year dissertation project I chose to implement a face liveness detection algorithm with a **convolutional neural network** that I have implemeted myself

The algorithm later on will be modified for **transfer learning**. At the moment it uses an existing dataset (NUAA dataset) and will be trained to identify face liveness for people with different facial characteristics.
